# Coursera Machine Learning solutions

My solutions to the coursera course on Machine learning by Andrew Ng. All in MatLab/Octave.

I completed this course to give me a general understanding of the principles of Machine Learning and the maths behind the different algorithms. In this course we gain experience writing and implementing many popular machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks and support vector machines. As well as clustering algorithms, anomaly detection and recommender systems.
